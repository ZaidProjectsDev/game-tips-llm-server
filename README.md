# To make this work you need to install node.js 
# Get the client from: https://github.com/ZaidProjectsDev/StudentProject-GameTipsLLMChatBot-ClientSide
Run the server by running "node App.js" in the terminal within the root of the project folder.
This does not use a database architecture. When the server is offline or reset, the chat history is lost.

**Important**
You need to create a .env file with an OpenAPI and RAWG API keys or it won't work. 


By default, the server uses port 3050 while the client uses port 3000
